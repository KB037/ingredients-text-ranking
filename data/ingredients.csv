Americano Coffee',"Type of coffee drink prepared by diluting an espresso with hot water, giving it a similar strength to, but different flavor from, traditionally brewed coffee. Its strength varies with the number of shots of espresso and amount of water added. The name is also spelled with varying capitalization and use of diacritics. Americanos�particularly short, long-black-style Americanos�are also used within artisanal espresso preparation for beans that produce strong espresso. This is particularly used for single origin espresso, where many find that undiluted espresso shots can prove overpowering; and with lighter coffees and roasts not generally associated with espresso, such as beans of Ethiopian or Sumatran origins. For this preparation, generally a ratio of 1:1 espresso to water is used, to prevent excess dilution, with the espresso pulled directly into a cup with existing water to minimize disruption to the crema."
'Baby Abalone'," is a common name for any of a group of small to very large marine gastropod molluscs in the family Haliotidae. Other common names are ear shells, sea ears, and, rarely, muttonfish or muttonshells in parts of Australia, ormer in the UK, perlemoen in South Africa, and the Maori name for three species in New Zealand is p?ua. Abalones are marine snails. Their taxonomy puts them in the family Haliotidae, which contains only one genus, Haliotis, which once contained six subgenera. These subgenera have become alternate representations of Haliotis. The number of species recognized worldwide ranges between 30 and 130 with over 230 species-level taxa described. The most comprehensive treatment of the family considers 56 species valid, with 18 additional subspecies. The shells of abalones have a low, open spiral structure, and are characterized by several open respiratory pores in a row near the shell's outer edge. The thick inner layer of the shell is composed of nacre (mother-of-pearl), which in many species is highly iridescent, giving rise to a range of strong, changeable colors which make the shells attractive to humans as decorative objects, jewelry, and as a source of colorful mother-of-pearl."
'Cadbury Double Decker Chocolate Bar',"The chocolate bar is structured in two layers; a lightly-whipped nougat layer, with a lower layer of cereal 'crispies', these are then coated in milk chocolate. Originally the bar contained raisins within the base layer; however, consumer research in the mid-1980s led to these being removed and the current formulation being introduced. Television adverts in the 1970s featured Willie Rushton before a mascot named Dougie the Double Decker Dog was introduced.The bar has a mass of approximately 54.5g  although multipack bars are smaller at 37.3g. This increased from 42g in the 1970s and 51g in the 1980s, to a peak of 60g before attaining the current weight. It typically contains 9.9g of fat, 38g of carbohydrates, 2.3g of protein and 1060kJ (250kcal) of energy. The Double Decker no longer contains hydrogenated oil. The bar is manufactured in Poland. There also existed a 'Double Decker � Nuts' launched in 2004, which had the advertising slogan ""crispy, crunchy, chewy and nutty"". This chocolate bar was essentially a Double Decker with nuts contained within the nougat layer; however, it has since been discontinued. At the time it was distinctly aimed at males, and featured in Coronation Street credits during 2004. In August 2016 Cadbury launched Dinky Deckers as part of the Bite Size bag range which are mini Cadbury Double Deckers available in a 120g pouch bag."
Campari Tomato',"Campari is a type of hybrid tomato noted for its juiciness, high sugar level, low acidity, and lack of mealiness. Camparis are deep red and larger than a pear or cherry tomato, but smaller and rounder than common plum tomatoes. They are often sold as ""tomato-on-the-vine"" (TOV) in supermarkets, a category of tomato that has become increasingly popular over the years. Campari tomatoes can be produced from different varieties with similar characteristics, the standard being Mountain Magic. As a hybrid, the seeds cost around $150,000 per pound. The company Mastronardi Produce registered the term ""Campari"" as a United States trademark for its tomatoes in 2003; however, the trademark was challenged in 2006 based on claims that ""Campari"" is actually the general name for the tomato variety bred in the 1990s by the Dutch company Enza Zaden"
Celery Soup',"Combine celery, potato, onion, and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat; season with kosher salt. Cook, stirring, until onion is tender, 8�10 minutes. Add broth; simmer until potatoes are tender, 8�10 minutes. Pur�e in a blender with dill; strain. Stir in cream. Serve soup topped with celery leaves, sea salt, and oil."
Chia Meal',"Chia seeds may be added to other foods as a topping or put into smoothies, breakfast cereals, energy bars, granola bars, yogurt, tortillas, and bread. They also may be made into a gelatin-like substance or consumed raw. The gel from ground seeds may be used in place of eggs in cakes while providing other nutrients, and is a common substitute in vegan and allergen-free baking. Unlike flax seeds, whole chia seeds do not need to be ground because the seed coat is delicate and readily digested, possibly improving nutrient bioavailability."
'Crunch Bars',"Crunch is a chocolate bar made of milk chocolate and crisped rice. It is produced globally by Nestl� with the exception of the United States, where it is produced under license by the Ferrara Candy Company, a subsidiary of Ferrero"
Cardamom',"Cardamom has a strong, unique taste, with an intensely aromatic, resinous fragrance. Black cardamom has a distinctly more smoky, though not bitter, aroma, with a coolness some consider similar to mint. Green cardamom is one of the most expensive spices by weight[16] but little is needed to impart flavour. It is best stored in the pod, as exposed or ground seeds quickly lose their flavour. Grinding the pods and seeds together lowers both the quality and the price. For recipes requiring whole cardamom pods, a generally accepted equivalent is 10 pods equals 1+1?2 teaspoons of ground cardamom. Cardamom is a common ingredient in Indian cooking. It is also often used in baking in the Nordic countries, in particular in Sweden, Norway, and Finland, where it is used in traditional treats such as the Scandinavian Yule bread Julekake, the Swedish kardemummabullar sweet bun, and Finnish sweet bread pulla. In the Middle East, green cardamom powder is used as a spice for sweet dishes, as well as traditional flavouring in coffee and tea. Cardamom is used to a wide extent in savoury dishes. In some Middle Eastern countries, coffee and cardamom are often ground in a wooden mortar, a mihbaj, and cooked together in a skillet, a mehmas, over wood or gas, to produce mixtures as much as 40% cardamom. In Asia, both types of cardamom are widely used in both sweet and savory dishes, particularly in the south. Both are frequent components in spice mixes, such as Indian and Nepali masalas and Thai curry pastes. Green cardamom is often used in traditional Indian sweets and in masala chai (spiced tea). Both are also often used as a garnish in basmati rice and other dishes. Individual seeds are sometimes chewed and used in much the same way as chewing gum. It is used by confectionery giant Wrigley; its Eclipse Breeze Exotic Mint packaging indicates the product contains ""cardamom to neutralize the toughest breath odors"". It is also included in aromatic bitters, gin, and herbal teas."
'Giardiniera',"The Italian version includes bell peppers, celery, carrots, cauliflower and gherkins. The pickled vegetables are marinated in oil, red- or white-wine vinegar, herbs and spices. Chicago-style giardiniera is commonly made spicy with sport peppers or chili flakes, along with a combination of assorted vegetables, including bell peppers, celery, carrots, cauliflower, and sometimes gherkins or olives all marinated in vegetable oil, olive oil, soybean oil, or any combination of the three. Some commercially prepared versions are labeled ""Chicago-style giardiniera""."
'Hog Maw',"Hog maw is the stomach of a pig. More specifically, it is the exterior muscular wall of the stomach organ (with interior, lining mucosa removed) which contains no fat if cleaned properly. It can be found in American, Soul Food, Chinese, Pennsylvania Dutch, Mexican, Portuguese and Italian dishes. In addition, it can be prepared in various ways including stewed, fried, baked, and broiled."
Mccormick Montreal Steak Seasoning',"Montreal steak seasoning, also known as Montreal steak spice, Canadian steak seasoning, or Canadian steak spice, is a spice mix used to flavour steak and grilled meats. It is based on the dry-rub mix used in preparing Montreal smoked meat, which comes from the Romanian pastram? (the ancestor of pastrami), introduced to Montreal by Romanian Jewish immigrants. The primary constituents of Montreal steak seasoning include garlic, coriander, black pepper, cayenne pepper flakes, dill seed, and salt. The spice mix recipe varies slightly among restaurants and manufacturers."
'Muesli',"is a cold breakfast dish, the primary ingredient of which is rolled oats, which is set to soak overnight and eaten the next morning. Most often, additional ingredients such as grains, nuts, seeds, and fresh or dried fruits, are added, along with milk or cream, a squeeze of citrus juice and, often, honey to sweeten. Yoghurt or other mammal or plant milk products are now commonly added to both homemade and commercially packaged muesli recipes."
'Mulberry',"As the fruit matures, mulberries change in texture and color, becoming succulent, plump, and juicy, resembling a blackberry. The color of the fruit does not distinguish the mulberry species, as mulberries may be white, lavender or black in color. White mulberry fruits are typically sweet, but not tart, while red mulberries are usually deep red, sweet, and juicy. Black mulberries are large and juicy, with balanced sweetness and tartness. The fruit of the East Asian white mulberry � a species extensively naturalized in urban regions of eastern North America � has a different flavor, sometimes characterized as refreshing and a little tart, with a bit of gumminess to it and a hint of vanilla. In North America, the white mulberry is considered an invasive exotic and has taken over extensive tracts from native plant species, including the red mulberry. Mulberries are used in pies, tarts, wines, cordials, and herbal teas. The fruit of the black mulberry (native to southwest Asia) and the red mulberry (native to eastern North America) have distinct flavors likened to 'fireworks in the mouth'. Jams and sherbets are often made from the fruit in the Old World."
'Munch Chocolate',"Sugar, Wheat flour (Maida), Hydrogenated vegetable fats (contain sesame oil), Milk solids, Cocoa solids (3.7%), Emulsifier (Soya lecithin), Leavening agent (500 (ii)), Yeast, Salt, Flour treatment agent (516) and improver (Enzymes)."
Murukku Packet',"is a savoury, crunchy snack originating from the�Indian subcontinent. The name�murukku�derives from the�Tamil�word for ""twisted"", which refers to its shape.�In India, murukku is especially popular in the states of�Andhra Pradesh,�Tamil Nadu,�Karnataka, and�Kerala. It is called�murkulu or janthukulu�in�Andhra Pradesh. It is also popular in countries with substantial presence of Indian and Sri Lankan diaspora, including�Singapore,�Fiji,�Malaysia, and�Myanmar�(Burma). Murukku, called�sagalay gway�(?????????;�lit.?'baby sparrow coils') in�Burmese, is a common snack and is used as a topping for a regional dish called�dawei�mont di."
Mango',"Mangoes are used in many cuisines. Sour, unripe mangoes are used in chutneys (i.e. Mango chutney), pickles, daals and other side dishes in Bengali cuisine. A summer drink called aam panna is made with mangoes. Mango pulp made into jelly or cooked with red gram dhal and green chillies may be served with cooked rice. Mango lassi is popular throughout South Asia,[37] prepared by mixing ripe mangoes or mango pulp with buttermilk and sugar. Ripe mangoes are also used to make curries. Aamras is a popular thick juice made of mangoes with sugar or milk, and is consumed with chapatis or pooris. The pulp from ripe mangoes is also used to make jam called mangada. Andhra aavakaaya is a pickle made from raw, unripe, pulpy, and sour mango, mixed with chili powder, fenugreek seeds, mustard powder, salt, and groundnut oil. Mango is also used in Andhra Pradesh to make dahl preparations. Gujaratis use mango to make chunda (a sweet and spicy, grated mango delicacy). Mangoes are used to make murabba (fruit preserves), muramba (a sweet, grated mango delicacy), amchur (dried and powdered unripe mango), and pickles, including a spicy mustard-oil pickle and alcohol. Ripe mangoes are often cut into thin layers, desiccated, folded, and then cut. These bars are similar to dried guava fruit bars available in some countries. The fruit is also added to cereal products such as muesli and oat granola. Mangoes are often prepared charred in Hawaii. Mango is used to make juices, smoothies, ice cream, fruit bars, raspados, aguas frescas, pies, and sweet chili sauce, or mixed with chamoy, a sweet and spicy chili paste. It is popular on a stick dipped in hot chili powder and salt or as a main ingredient in fresh fruit combinations. In Central America, mango is either eaten green mixed with salt, vinegar, black pepper, and hot sauce, or ripe in various forms. Pieces of mango can be mashed and used as a topping on ice cream or blended with milk and ice as milkshakes. Sweet glutinous rice is flavored with coconut, then served with sliced mango as a dessert. In other parts of Southeast Asia, mangoes are pickled with fish sauce and rice vinegar. Green mangoes can be used in mango salad with fish sauce and dried shrimp. Mango with condensed milk may be used as a topping for shaved ice. Raw green mangoes can be sliced and eaten like a salad.[38] In most parts of Southeast Asia, they are commonly eaten with fish sauce, vinegar, soy sauce, or with a dash of salt (plain or spicy) � a combination usually known as ""mango salad"" in English."
Organic Maize',"Raw, yellow, sweet maize kernels are composed of 76% water, 19% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and 1% fat (table). In a 100-gram serving, maize kernels provide 86 calories and are a good source (10�19% of the Daily Value) of the B vitamins, thiamin, niacin (but see Pellagra warning below), pantothenic acid (B5) and folate (right table for raw, uncooked kernels, USDA Nutrient Database). In moderate amounts, they also supply dietary fiber and the essential minerals, magnesium and phosphorus whereas other nutrients are in low amounts. Maize has suboptimal amounts of the essential amino acids tryptophan and lysine, which accounts for its lower status as a protein source.[138] However, the proteins of beans and legumes complement those of maize"
Organic Peruvian Groundcherry',"Estimates for the earliest use of Physalis for human consumption range from 900BCE to 5000BCE. Archaeological sites support the historical use of Physalis as a food for indigenous people in what is now northern Mexico and portions of the United States. Physalis fruit are rich in cryptoxanthin. The fruit can be used like the tomato. Once extracted from its husk, it can be eaten raw and used in salads. Some varieties are added to desserts, used as flavoring, made into fruit preserves, or dried and used like raisins. They contain pectin and can be used in pie filling. Ground cherries are called poha in the Hawaiian language, and poha jam and preserves are traditional desserts made from Physalis plants grown on the Hawaiian Islands. Physalis plants grow in most soil types and do very well in poor soils and in pots. They require moisture until fruiting. Plants are susceptible to many of the common tomato diseases and pests, and other pests such as aphids, whiteflies, spider mites, and the false potato beetle (Leptinotarsa juncta) also attack them. Propagation is by seed."
Organic Tartar Cream',"Tartar sauce is based on either mayonnaise (egg yolk, mustard or vinegar, bitartrate, oil) or aioli (olive oil, garlic), with certain other ingredients added. In the UK, recipes typically add to the base capers, gherkins, lemon juice, and dill. US recipes may include chopped dill pickles, onions (or chives), and fresh parsley. Chopped hard-boiled eggs or olives are sometimes added, as may be Dijon mustard and cocktail onions."
Orange Extract',"Orange oil is an essential oil produced by cells within the rind of an orange fruit (Citrus sinensis fruit). In contrast to most essential oils, it is extracted as a by-product of orange juice production by centrifugation, producing a cold-pressed oil. It is composed of mostly (greater than 90%) d-limonene, and is often used in place of pure d-limonene. D-limonene can be extracted from the oil by distillation."
Pickled Cauliflower',"Cauliflower � Cauliflower, of course, is the star of this recipe. Choose a firm, closed head of cauliflower. If you are using white cauliflower, try to avoid cauliflower with any dark spots. Red and orange bell pepper � Bell peppers add extra flavor to this recipe. Both red and orange bell peppers are sweeter than green bell peppers and won�t add heat. Vinegar � Vinegar is the active ingredient in pickling vegetables. For the best results, use a combination of white vinegar and apple cider vinegar. Water � As written, you use equal parts of water and vinegar. For more tang, you can reduce the amount of water in the recipe. Garlic � Fresh garlic cloves add zip to the cauliflower. Sugar � White sugar helps to balance the acidity of the vinegar. Use a sugar substitute to keep these cauliflower pickles keto or omit it all together if you prefer. Salt � Salt is a major part of the pickling brine. Use kosher salt or pickling salt. Spices � For maximum yum factor, use a blend of mustard seed, coriander, black peppercorns and a pinch of red pepper flakes."
Pork Chump Chops',"A pork chop, like other meat chops, is a loin cut taken perpendicular to the spine of the pig and is usually a rib or part of a vertebra. Pork chops are unprocessed and leaner than other cuts. Chops are commonly served as an individual portion, and can be accompanied with applesauce, vegetables, and other sides. Pork is one of the most commonly consumed meats in the world. In the United States, pork chops are the most commonly consumed meat cut from the pork loin and account for 10% of total pork consumption. It comes from the pork shoulder."
Pork Lungs',"variety meats, pluck or organ meats, is the organs of a butchered animal. The word does not refer to a particular list of edible organs, which varies by culture and region, but usually excludes muscle.[citation needed] Offal may also refer to the by-products of milled grains, such as corn or wheat. Some cultures strongly consider offal as food to be taboo, while others use it as everyday food, or even as delicacies. Certain offal dishes�including foie gras, p�t�, and haggis �are internationally regarded as gourmet food in the culinary arts. Others remain part of traditional regional cuisine and may be consumed especially in connection with holidays. This includes sweetbread, Jewish chopped liver, U.S. chitterlings, Mexican menudo, as well as many other dishes. On the other hand, intestines are traditionally used as casing for sausages. Depending on the context, offal may refer only to those parts of an animal carcass discarded after butchering or skinning; offal not used directly for human or animal consumption is often processed in a rendering plant, producing material that is used for fertilizer or fuel; or in some cases, it may be added to commercially produced pet food.[citation needed] In earlier times, mobs sometimes threw offal and other rubbish at condemned criminals as a show of public disapproval."
Pork Tripe',"Tripe refers to cow (beef) stomach, but includes stomach of any ruminant including cattle, sheep, deer, antelope, goat, ox, giraffes, and their relatives. Tripas, the related Spanish word, also refers to culinary dishes produced from any animal with a stomach. In some cases, other names have been applied to the tripe of other animals. For example, tripe from pigs may be referred to as paunch, pig bag, or hog maw."
Peanut Butter',"Peanut butter is included as an ingredient in many recipes: peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, peanut butter cookies, and candies where peanut is the main flavor, such as Reese's Pieces, or various peanut butter and chocolate treats, such as Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and the Crispy Crunch candy bar. Peanut butter's flavor combines well with other flavors, such as oatmeal, cheese, cured meats, savory sauces, and various types of breads and crackers. The creamy or crunchy, fatty, salty taste pairs very well with complementary soft and sweet ingredients like fruit preserves, bananas, apples, and honey. The taste can also be enhanced by similarly salty things like bacon (see Peanut butter, banana and bacon sandwich), especially if the peanut butter has added sweetness. One snack for children is called ""ants on a log"", with a celery stick acting as the ""log"". The groove in the celery stick is filled with peanut butter and raisins arranged in a row along the top are ""ants"". Plumpy'nut is a peanut butter-based food used to fight malnutrition in famine-stricken countries. A single pack contains 500 calories, can be stored unrefrigerated for 2 years, and requires no cooking or preparation."
Smokies Sausage',"A sausage is a type of meat product usually made from ground meat�often pork, beef, or poultry�along with salt, spices and other flavourings. Other ingredients, such as grains or breadcrumbs may be included as fillers or extenders. When used as an adjective, the word sausage can refer to the loose sausage meat, which can be formed into patties or stuffed into a skin. When referred to as ""a sausage"", the product is usually cylindrical and encased in a skin. Typically, a sausage is formed in a casing traditionally made from intestine, but sometimes from synthetic materials. Sausages that are sold raw are cooked in many ways, including pan-frying, broiling and barbecuing. Some sausages are cooked during processing, and the casing may then be removed."
Snickers Spread',"The early (1939) ingredients list includes white sugar, sweet milk chocolate, corn syrup, peanuts, milk condensed with sugar, coconut oil, malted milk, whites of eggs and salt. By 2019, the ingredients for the original bar had been refined to milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, chocolate, skim milk, lactose, milkfat, soy lecithin, artificial flavor), peanuts, corn syrup, sugar, palm oil, skim milk, lactose, salt, egg whites, artificial flavor"
Strawberry Gelatin',"Probably best known as a gelling agent in cooking, different types and grades of gelatin are used in a wide range of food and nonfood products. Common examples of foods that contain gelatin are gelatin desserts, trifles, aspic, marshmallows, candy corn, and confections such as Peeps, gummy bears, fruit snacks, and jelly babies. Gelatin may be used as a stabilizer, thickener, or texturizer in foods such as yogurt, cream cheese, and margarine; it is used, as well, in fat-reduced foods to simulate the mouthfeel of fat and to create volume. It also is used in the production of several types of Chinese soup dumplings, specifically Shanghainese soup dumplings, or xiaolongbao, as well as Shengjian mantou, a type of fried and steamed dumpling. The fillings of both are made by combining ground pork with gelatin cubes, and in the process of cooking, the gelatin melts, creating a soupy interior with a characteristic gelatinous stickiness. Gelatin is used for the clarification of juices, such as apple juice, and of vinegar. Isinglass is obtained from the swim bladders of fish. It is used as a fining agent for wine and beer. Besides hartshorn jelly, from deer antlers (hence the name ""hartshorn""), isinglass was one of the oldest sources of gelatin."
Salmon',"Raw wild salmon is 70% water, 20% protein, 6% fat, and contains no carbohydrates (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, raw salmon supplies 142 calories, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of several B vitamins, especially vitamin B12 at 133% DV, selenium (52% DV), and phosphorus (29% DV). Dietary minerals in moderate content are copper (15% DV) and potassium"
'Tomato',"A tomato is 95% water, contains 4% carbohydrates and less than 1% each of fat and protein (table). 100 g of raw tomatoes supply 18 kilocalories and are a moderate source of vitamin C (17% of the Daily Value), but otherwise have no significant nutrient content."
Tamarind',"The fruit is harvested by pulling the pod from its stalk. A mature tree may be capable of producing up to 175 kilograms (386 pounds) of fruit per year. Veneer grafting, shield (T or inverted T) budding, and air layering may be used to propagate desirable cultivars. Such trees will usually fruit within three to four years if provided optimum growing conditions. The fruit pulp is edible. The hard green pulp of a young fruit is considered by many to be too sour, but is often used as a component of savory dishes, as a pickling agent or as a means of making certain poisonous yams in Ghana safe for human consumption. As the fruit matures it becomes sweeter and less sour (acidic) and the ripened fruit is considered more palatable. The sourness varies between cultivars and some sweet tamarind ones have almost no acidity when ripe. In Western cuisine, tamarind pulp is found in Worcestershire Sauce and HP Sauce. Tamarind paste has many culinary uses including a flavoring for chutneys, curries, and the traditional sharbat syrup drink. Tamarind sweet chutney is popular in India and Pakistan as a dressing for many snacks and often served with samosa. Tamarind pulp is a key ingredient in flavoring curries and rice in south Indian cuisine, in the Chigali lollipop, in rasam, and in certain varieties of masala chai tea. Across the Middle East, from the Levant to Iran, tamarind is used in savory dishes, notably meat-based stews, and often combined with dried fruits to achieve a sweet-sour tang. In the Philippines, the whole fruit is used as an ingredient in the traditional dish called sinigang to add a unique sour taste, unlike that of dishes that use vinegar instead. Indonesia also has a similarly sour, tamarind-based soup dish called sayur asem. In Mexico and the Caribbean, the pulp is diluted with water and sugared to make an agua fresca drink. It is widely used throughout all of M�xico for candy making, including tamarind mixed with chilli powder candy. The leaves and bark are also edible, and the seeds can be cooked to make safe for consumption. Blanched, tender tamarind leaves are used in a Burmese salad called magyi ywet thoke, a salad from Upper Myanmar that features tender blanched tamarind leaves, garlic, onions, roasted peanuts, and pounded dried shrimp."

Vegan Marshmallow',"If you�ve never really analyzed marshmallow ingredients or thought about what�s in your food, you may not even know that regular marshmallows contain gelatin which is a form of boiled down pork bones, fats, and more. This substance is used to make the texture of marshmallows. Vegans don�t consume any animal products, so that means they have to use something besides gelatin to make marshmallows. Today, we�ll be using agar agar which is a seaweed substance to make our vegan marshmallow. Don�t worry, your marshmallows won�t taste like they are from the ocean, it doesn�t have a taste."
Vegan Puff Pastry Sheet',"Puff pastry is sold solely on the basis of being vegan. Aside from being gluten-free, the cake includes only buckwheat flour and salt. In addition to being kosher certified, it is frequently used in vegan pie and pastry recipes. Every time, we use this recipe because it has no strange ingredients and is simple to prepare. You can tailor your pastry to your specific requirements by selecting eight different flavors. There are two main types of shortcrusts to choose from: savoury and sweet. Each of the recipes includes four flavor variations. When chilled, the dough will be a little softer and stickier than you expect, and it will become easier to roll once it has settled down. After brushing the pastry with the margarine, sprinkle it with 25g vegan cheese. To make the dough more sticky, add 1tbsp dijon or wholegrain mustard. This vegan shortcrust pastry can be used to make almost any dish, with eight different flavor variations. Because it�s so simple to implement, the results are astounding on a regular basis. There are vegan brands (such as Jus-Rol and most supermarket own brands) that contain milk, but there is no luxury all-butter variety with milk. When you add ground almonds or vanilla extract, you will need to add them right away. If you are using vegan butter or milk, make sure it is completely chilled. You will have a better-textured pastry and will be less likely to scratch it when rubbing it in. If you have time, it is a good idea to cool the pastry before cooking (roll it into your tart case or pie dish). It will keep the meat from sticking to the sides and cooking too quickly."

Vegan White Cake',"The main difference between a vegan white cake and a vegan vanilla cake is just trying to make the color as light as possible. To make this white cake as white as possible, I used a clear vanilla extract, almond milk, which is very white in color, and baking powder instead of baking soda. Baking powder tends to result in a lighter color for baked goods so worked great here."
Vegetable Stock',"Vegetable stock, also called vegetable broth, is typically a clear liquid made from boiling a variety of different vegetables and herbs. It is often used as a replacement for bouillon and other meat stocks, like chicken stock. Mirepoix, a combination of onions, carrots, celery, and sometimes other vegetables. Often the less desirable parts of the vegetables (such as carrot skins and celery ends) are used since they will not be eaten."
Vinegar',"Vinegar is commonly used in food preparation, in particular as pickling liquids, vinaigrettes, and other salad dressings. It is an ingredient in sauces, such as hot sauce, mustard, ketchup, and mayonnaise. Vinegar is sometimes used in chutneys. It is often used as a condiment on its own, or as a part of other condiments. Marinades often contain vinegar. Soups sometimes have vinegar added to them, as is the case with hot and sour soup. In terms of its shelf life, vinegar's acidic nature allows it to last indefinitely without the use of refrigeration; it is essentially already ""spoiled"". A beverage made from apple vinegar in China. Several beverages are made using vinegar, for instance posca in ancient Rome. The ancient Greek drink oxymel is made from vinegar and honey, and sekanjabin is a traditional Persian drink similar to oxymel. Other preparations, known colloquially as ""shrubs"", range from simply mixing sugar water or honey water with small amounts of fruity vinegar, to making syrup by laying fruit or mint in vinegar for several days, then sieving off solid parts and adding considerable amounts of sugar. Some prefer to boil the ""shrub"" as a final step. These recipes have lost much of their popularity with the rise of carbonated beverages, such as soft drinks. Preliminary research indicates that consuming 2-4 tablespoons of vinegar may cause small reductions in post-meal levels of blood glucose and insulin in people with diabetes. Distilled or red wine vinegar is 95% water, with no fat or protein. In a 100 mL (3+1?2 US fl oz) reference amount, distilled vinegar supplies 75 kJ (18 kcal) of food energy and no micronutrients in significant content. The composition (and absence of nutrient content) for red wine vinegar and apple cider vinegar are the same, whereas balsamic vinegar is 77% water with 17% carbohydrates, 370 kJ (88 kcal) per 100 mL, and contains no fat, protein, or micronutrients."
